# VBA-challenge

Screenshot#Alphabet.png are screenshots showing the page with instructions as followed just like how it should look in Canvas. This also is the same for Screenshot#Year.png.

The two .vbs files are also labeled as shown.

The two XLSM files are also labeled which shows each sheet as worked on. Please excuse some personal notes as I added a few for future reference if needed.
